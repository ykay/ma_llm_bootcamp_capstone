# Week 2 Capstone - Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a "Max Academy Bootcamp" LLM that provides accurate answers about the course for students who want to review topics that were taught during a lecture, upcoming assignments, deadlines, and anything else relevant to the course. The LLM will be trained with video transcripts from the recorded lectures and course documents which will allow it to provide answers along with relevant timestamps (when an answer comes from a recorded video) when this was discussed. 

Here are some various use cases where this project can be applied: 
- A "student aid" service that extracts key takeaways and things to do, by providing an LLM that evolves over time as it accumulates knowledge from past lectures and course material.
